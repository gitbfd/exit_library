**_Marc Andreessen’s Time-Tested Strategies for Navigating VC Rejections and Achieving Success_**

In today’s funding winter phase, launching a startup is easy, but securing the right amount of funding is tough. With VC funding going down significantly, this challenge remains a major hurdle for aspiring entrepreneurs even in 2024.

But have you ever wondered why VCs say NO and why they don’t say it directly? They often use phrases like “maybe” or “not right now.” This might seem frustrating, but it actually leaves the door open for future possibilities. In such situations, founders might get overwhelmed with several questions:

> How can I turn a NO from VC into a YES?
> 
> How can I address the risks VCs see in startups?
> 
> And, what strategies can keep me in the game even after hearing “NO”?

So to ease all your worries we’ll guide you through the steps to refine your business plan, minimize risks, and help you turn setbacks into new opportunities.

Key Stats
---------

*   Wellington Management reports that VC fund payouts dropped by 84% from 2021 to 2023.
*   Andy Rachleff’s Onion Theory of Risk compares startups to onions, with multiple layers of risks.
*   Marc Andreessen states that his VC firm receives 3,000 deals annually but invests in only 15–20.

According to a report by Wellington Management, payouts from VC funds fell dramatically by [84%](https://www.wellington.com/en-us/institutional/insights/vc-outlook-signals-point-to-a-brighter-2024) between 2021 and 2023. This decrease has led to a large buildup of unused capital and has made it harder for companies to get funding. As we enter 2024, raising funds is still a big challenge for new companies.

> _“_At our venture capital firm, we only invest in a sort of Silicon Valley-style tech. We see 3,000 inbound deals a year. And those are inbound and coming through our referral network, so those are sort of prequalified. We can do maybe 15 or 20 investments out of the [3,000](https://a16z.com/the-future-of-work-cars-and-the-wisdom-in-saying-no/) a year. So I like to say our day job is crushing entrepreneurs’ hopes and dreams. Our main skill is saying no, and getting people to not hate us”- **Marc Andreessen.**

In 2024, hearing a “NO” from investors means something different than it did in previous years. If you’re facing rejection now, it’s likely due to a combination of factors, including market conditions, competition, and the quality of your proposal.

The hidden meaning behind their “Maybe,” “Not right now,” “My partners aren’t sure,” or “That’s interesting, could mean that they’re not ready to invest based on the current information, but they want to keep the door open in case things change.

So, when you hear these typical responses, follow the steps below to improve your chances of getting funded in the near future:

Laying the Groundwork for Future Engagement
-------------------------------------------

If you receive a “NO” from a few VCs, it might just be a coincidence. However, if multiple VCs turn you down, it’s a sign that there may be an issue with your idea, or the product/services you are offering. In such a case, instead of pitching to more VCs, it’s more effective to revisit and improve your plan.

Remember, each pitch is a learning experience. Use feedback to improve your business plan, refine your pitch, and address weaknesses. Gracefully handle rejections by politely requesting feedback, even if it’s not fully candid. Show appreciation for their time and consideration, demonstrating respect and professionalism. This iterative process is key to eventually securing the investment you need.

Additionally, ask if you can keep in touch and follow up in the future. This approach keeps the door open for future opportunities and demonstrates that you’re receptive to advice and committed to improving your startup idea.

**Retool Your Plan**
--------------------

When seeking funds from investors, make sure you are **minimizing risks and maximizing returns for them**. Investors approach startup risks like peeling an onion — layer by layer. They examine each risk and want to see how you manage and reduce them.

[Andy Rachleff’s](https://theventurecrew.substack.com/p/marc-andreessen-understand-onion) **Onion Theory of Risk** offers a very interesting perspective on startups, especially before they receive seed funding. According to this theory, a startup is like an onion, with multiple layers of risk that need to be peeled away. Each layer represents a different aspect of uncertainty that investors must consider.

Marc Andreessen builds on this concept by explaining how investors assess a company’s value through its risk and reward profile. Essentially, investors view valuation as the inverse of risk: **the more risks your startup has, the lower its valuation. Conversely, the more risks you’ve peeled off, your startup’s valuation increases.** As an entrepreneur raising venture capital, your goal is to keep reducing the risks in your startup until VCs are confident enough to say “YES.”

Strategies for Managing and Minimizing Startup Risks
----------------------------------------------------

Let us look at some of the startup risks and find out the way to manage them carefully :

**Founder’s Risk:**

The startup’s success heavily depends on the founders’ skills, experience, and chemistry. If the founding team is missing key skills or has internal conflicts, it can jeopardize the startup’s future. Ensure the team has a mix of technical and business skills. For example, a tech startup typically needs a highly skilled developer and a business manager. If necessary, they should bring in experienced advisors or additional co-founders to fill the gaps.

**Market Risk :**

There may be uncertainty about whether there is a genuine demand for the product, how much customers are willing to pay, and if the product will fit into the market. To overcome, market risk try conducting surveys, and group interviews to gather data on customer needs and their willingness to pay. Launch a minimal version of the product (MVP) to test market demand and gather feedback from the customers.

**Competition Risk:**

The presence of many competitors or the lack of clear product differentiation can undermine the startup’s chances of standing out in the market. Analyze their strengths and weaknesses to understand where you stand. Clearly articulate what makes your product unique and why it’s better or different from existing solutions. Continuously monitor the competitive landscape and adapt your strategy to maintain a competitive edge.

**Timing Risk:**

The startup might be too early, meaning the market isn’t ready for the product, or too late, meaning the market is saturated. So before thinking of the product idea, startups need to evaluate market trends and consumer readiness. Align your product development and launch with current market conditions to ensure it meets demand and fits the timing of the market. Look out for early adopters who are willing to try new technologies or solutions, which can help validate timing. And lastly, be flexible and ready to pivot if market conditions change.

**Financing Risk:**

There is huge uncertainty about how much capital will be needed in future rounds and how this impacts the startup’s ability to sustain operations and scale rapidly. To manage financial risk, create detailed projections, estimate future funding needs carefully, and adjust your plan to require less money. Present a clear funding strategy and milestones to investors.

**Distribution Risk:**

If a startup relies on one or a few key distribution partners (like retailers, wholesalers, or online platforms), the failure of these partners to perform or meet expectations can severely impact the startup’s ability to grow. So to avoid last-time mishaps, seek and negotiate distribution partnerships early in the process to ensure you have access to necessary channels. Explore alternative distribution methods, such as direct-to-consumer models or partnerships with online platforms.

**Technological Risk:**

The technology being used by startups may be new, experimental, or untested on a large scale. If the technology does not work as intended, it can delay the product’s launch, increase costs, or lead to failure in meeting market needs. You can hire a team with the technical expertise, and conduct thorough testing to ensure the technology meets requirements and performs well. Make sure you test your idea on the beta launch and then raise money.

**Hiring Risk**

It involves difficulties in recruiting and retaining the right talent, which can affect a startup’s ability to execute its plans. The major obstacles related to hiring risk could be the challenge of finding qualified candidates, dealing with high turnover, and having unfilled important job roles. To address these issues, actively seek out top talent, foster a positive work environment, and prioritize hiring for essential positions that VCs look out for. If necessary, consider temporary hires to cover any gaps.

**Location Risk:**

It involves challenges like limited access to investors, difficulty finding talent, and operational constraints due to the startup’s location. If you’re struggling to raise funds and aren’t based in a major entrepreneurial hub, you might need to relocate. Just as most films are made in Los Angeles and most tech startups in the U.S. are in Silicon Valley, being in the right place can significantly boost your chances of securing investment and succeeding.
